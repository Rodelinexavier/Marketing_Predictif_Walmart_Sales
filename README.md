# Bloc3_Certification_Walmart
Project 🚧
Walmart's marketing service has asked you to build a machine learning model able to estimate the weekly sales in their stores, 
with the best precision possible on the predictions made. Such a model would help them understand better how the sales are influenced by economic indicators, and might be used to plan future marketing campaigns.

Deliverable 📬
To complete this project, your team should:

Create some visualizations
Train at least one linear regression model on the dataset, that predicts the amount of weekly sales as a function of the other variables
Assess the performances of the model by using a metric that is relevant for regression problems
Interpret the coefficients of the model to identify what features are important for the prediction
Train at least one model with regularization (Lasso or Ridge) to reduce overfitting
